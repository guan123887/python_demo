In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Python operator precedence and associativity. 
This topic is crucial for programmers to understand the semantics of Python operators.
After reading it, you should be able to know how Python evaluates the order of its operators. 
Some operators have higher precedence than others such as the multiplication operator has higher priority than the addition operator, 
so do multiplication before addition.
